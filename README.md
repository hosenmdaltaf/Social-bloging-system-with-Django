# Overview
In today's world, the internet is like a cell of our body. We cannot think a moment without the internet. As civilization goes on, people have spread all over the world. Without the internet, communication is impossible. At this point, we all depend on social platforms. Nowadays, social platform gives us everything we need from the internet such as educational videos and writing, news, funny posts etc. But lack of good news and trusted platforms are very rare.We always see our data leakage.  Almost all social platforms are missing of quality content, many fake news, fraud case all related to the social platforms. We spend most of our time on social sites, but at the end of the day, it is all about wasting our valuable time. So, I come up with the idea of a social blogging platform that will provide only quality content. This platform forces us to learn new things from the excellent writer, and we can ask questions if we want to learn. We want to develop an
association of helping hands. By resolving all the existing problems, it will be strict to security and user data.  After emerging our application, anyone can feel the success by creating something special. All the missing puzzles will be found here and playing no hide and seek with the users. This project will be an open source, and anyone can see what they are using. we see a lot of social media and blogging site.  Facebook, twitter, We Chat etc. are mainstream sites. For blogging medium, dev.to and many more names. In a while, I saw that there is a lot of missing puzzle in this system. As the best alternative for my project is medium or dev.to. But they do not have any solution for a direct communication system except commenting in a blog. The top social sites are disaster for quality reading. So I came up the idea of putting all of these missing puzzles together. In my application it will be full of quality content, there will be a super chance to grow up the community. It will provide a real-time messaging system and discussion forum for everyone, so anyone can get help if gets stuck. I also used Artificial intelligence for prediction, recommendation and suggestion. A recommendation system is important in our social life due to its strength in providing enhanced entertainment. the prediction will inspire writers as they get more audience in their blogs so they give us more satisfying blogs. In this project, I tried to show how Artificial intelligence involved in our real life as that we always reads in papers and everyone talking around I show the implementations with our blogs prediction and suggestion. This can be useful to predict making future decisions. It mines our databases to gather all the vital data, such as contents and title, required for the suggestion. It produces motion picture swarms not as it were helpful for a writer to select their niche for there and forced them to deliver good content for readers. Exploratory ponders on genuine information uncover the effectiveness and viability of our project.
